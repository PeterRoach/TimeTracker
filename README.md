# TimeTracker
A basic application for tracking time and tasks.
To get started:
1. Use TimeTracker.sql to set up the database in MS SQL Server.
2. Edit the connection string in Constants.vb to specific needs. In most cases, just update the instance name in the Data Source.
3. Build and run.
Note: See Images/Screenshots to get an idea of what the application looks like.
